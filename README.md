Atvanzt has created a public environment with which Synology packages for HashiCorp can be created automatically.

Releases are stored in this repository. A release contains release notes which refer the official HashiCorp release.

The spk file in the Assets of a specific release can be downloaded for installation on a compatible Synology NAS.

The packages are created using the [official Synology build environment](https://github.com/SynologyOpenSource/pkgscripts-ng).

Currently only Avoton based packages are created and released. See list of [CPUâ€™s and architectures](https://kb.synology.com/en-us/DSM/tutorial/What_kind_of_CPU_does_my_NAS_have) to understand which Synology devices support Avoton.

If there are people interested in other architectures, please contact us.
