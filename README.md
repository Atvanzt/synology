Atvanzt has created a public environment with which Synology packages for HashiCorp can be created automatically.

Releases are stored in this repository. A release contains release notes which refer the official HashiCorp release.

The spk file in the Assets of a specific release can be downloaded for installation on a compatible Synology NAS.

The packages are created using the official Synology build environment.

Currently only Avoton based packages are created and released. See list of CPUâ€™s and architectures to understand which Synology devices support Avoton.

If there are people interested in other supported architecture, please contact us.
